# Calamari

OCR4all can be considered a user-friendly GUI for the OCR-engine `calamari`.
This means that file generated in the OCR4all workflow can be modified with the more powerful calamari CLI.

In this section, I try to bring together some hints as to how to use `calamari` in addition to OCR4all.

For more information on Calamari, see the [Calamari Website](https://github.com/Calamari-OCR/calamari) and the [Docs](https://calamari-ocr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
