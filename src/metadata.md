# Manage your metadata

If you work on more than a handful of projects it is easy to loose track of where you got your files from.

It is therefore a good idea to store some metadata about your scans in the project folder.

If you download images from a library website, you will probably find a MARCxml or a METS file.
Download it and put it into your project folder, so that you can look up all information you might need later on.

If there is no such file, save an persistent ID (DOI, URN or permalink) to the resource you are using in a file (e.g. `metadata.txt`) in your project folder.
